# Intro-to-Genetic-Algorithm
An introduction to Genetic Algorithm for optimization problem

"Genetic algorithms (GAs) are stochastic search algorithms inspired by the basic principles of biological evolution and natural selection. GAs simulate the evolution of living organisms, where the fittest individuals dominate over the weaker ones, by mimicking the biological mechanisms of evolution, such as selection, crossover and mutation." - Luca Scrucca
