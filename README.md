# Introduction to Genetic Algorithm

Wonderful nature always bless us with its untaped potential and unlimited inspiration for science and engineering. Genetic algorithm is the adoption of evolution by natural selection for optimization problem.

This page is dedicated for introduction to Genetic Algorithm for optimization problem with `GA` package in R (https://github.com/luca-scr/GA) 

"Genetic algorithms (GAs) are stochastic search algorithms inspired by the basic principles of biological evolution and natural selection. GAs simulate the evolution of living organisms, where the fittest individuals dominate over the weaker ones, by mimicking the biological mechanisms of evolution, such as selection, crossover and mutation." - Luca Scrucca
